# Calendaring

This is the repository where we store the code to more easily generate printable calendars. Doing things in code makes sure there are fewer problems with mixing dates and days.

There are a few different kinds of calendars we use on a regular basis, you can read more about the specifics at http://optional.is/required/2014/08/27/paper-calendars/

In this repository there is code to create an A4 quarterly calendar, four columns one sheet of paper.

An A7 pocketmod booklet for each quarter. 

An A6 calendar with a year calendar split over 4 pages, one for each Quarter. This shold be printed on an A3 sheet to start with.

Finally an A5 notebook specific to your weeknumber.
