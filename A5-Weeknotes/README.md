The A5-Generator will output a week planner for each quarter. This can easily be bound-up to take weeknotes.

Usage:
php A5-generator.php

This will create a different svg file for each week. Depending on your printer you will need to print weeks 1-7, then feed them back through the printer to print on the other side. Starting with the cover, then weeks 8-13.
